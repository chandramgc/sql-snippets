Additive	- Can be summed up over any combination of dimensions
Non-additive- Measuers of intensity which cannont be summed i.e temperature. 
Semi-Additive-Cannot be summed across all dimensions i.e balances cannont be summed over time

Three Fundamental Fact Grains
Transaction	- Represents an instantaneous measurement at a specific point in space and time
			  Transaction gain records are created only if the measurement events take place
Periodic Snapshot Facts	- Grain of a Periodic snapshot can be Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, etc
			  Usually an 'open' current rolling period
Accumulating Snapshot Facts - Individual record is created when a shipment invoice is created
			  Unknown dimensions are not applicatle and their surrogate keys must point to the special record in the dimension
			  corresponding to Not Applicable
			  
Bridge Tables-Many Dimension Values to One Fact
Processing Bridge Table - Determine if the Diagnosis group exists. If not, assign group key and populate the bridge table

Dimension
Audit Dimension - Dummy row for records with no defects
			  Audit dimensions can be unique to each fact table 
			  Error Event Fact can be used to fill in the measures of the audit dimension 
Conforming Dimensions - Identify the source systems
			  Understand the source systems
			  create record matching logic
			  establish survivorship rules
			  establish non-key attribute business rules
			  assign surrogate key 
			  load conformed dimension
Junk Dimension-Combine small, low cardinality dimension
			  Create the cartesian product of values
			  
Advance Data Delivery Techniques
Raggerd Hierarchies - Blocks represent individual customer entities, connenceted in an organization tree. 
			  Assume that revenue can be received from any or all of these entities
			  In the OLTP, this type of hierarchy is usually modeled as a single table with a recursive key
Late Arriving Data - Information about a trasaction is provided after the trasaction has already been migrated to the data warehouse
			  Bad data that has already been migrated to data warehouse is corrected in the source systems
			  Late Arriving Data (LAD) can occur in Dimensions or facts
			  LAD in fact tables should be handled as a seperate thoroughly tested, process form the typical data load
Late Arriving Facts - Using a customer-purchase scenario, suppose we receive today a purchase record that is several month old.
			  We must insert this late arriving record into its correct historical position.

Types of ETL Metadata
Business Metadata - Describes the meaning of the data in a business sense
Technical Metadata - Represents the technical aspects of the data including attribute such as data types, lengths, lineage and so on
Process Metadata - Presents statistics on the ETL process. Includes measure such as rows loaded successfully, rows rejected amount of time to load and so on.
